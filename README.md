# Car Brand Classification using Transfer Learning

## Project Overview
Architected an end-to-end computer vision pipeline to classify automotive brands from high-resolution images. By leveraging Transfer Learning and a ResNet-50 architecture, this project demonstrates the ability to handle large-scale image data and optimize deep learning models for real-world environmental noise.

## Key Features & Impact
* **Engineered** a robust classification model using PyTorch, achieving a 14% increase in decision accuracy (81% total) over baseline threshold methods.
* **Processed** a dataset of 8,000+ images from the Stanford Car Dataset...
* **Optimized** training efficiency...
* **Developed** a modular codebase...

## Technical Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Frameworks:** PyTorch, Torchvision
* **Libraries:** Pandas (Data manipulation), NumPy (Numerical analysis), Matplotlib (Visualization), PIL (Image processing)
* **Model Architecture:** ResNet-50

## Dataset Information
* **Volume:** Utilized a comprehensive dataset of **16,000+ total images**.
* **Training Set:** **8,000+ labeled images** used for supervised learning and feature extraction.
* **Testing Set:** **8,000+ images** reserved for final model evaluation and accuracy benchmarking.
* **Preprocessing Pipeline:** All images were normalized to **ImageNet standards** and resized using a **224x224 CenterCrop** to ensure optimal compatibility with the ResNet-50 architecture.
